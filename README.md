Configuration module for PHP that supports multiple application stages like `dev`, `prod` or `something else` 
and overrides the `defaults` stage.

## Installation

```bash
composer require spacetab-io/configuration
```

## Usage

By default, path to configuration directory and application stage
loading from `/app/configuration` with `local` stage.

1) Simple
```php
<?php
use Spacetab\Configuration\Configuration;

$conf = new Configuration();
$conf->load();

var_dump($conf->all()); // get all config
echo $conf->get('foo.bar'); // get nested key use dot notation
echo $conf['foo.bar']; // the same, but use ArrayAccess interface.
```

Supported dot-notation syntax with an asterisk in `get` method. 
You can read about it here: https://github.com/spacetab-io/obelix-php

2) If u would like override default values, you can pass 2 arguments to
class constructor or set up use setters.

```php
<?php
use Spacetab\Configuration\Configuration;

$conf = new Configuration(__DIR__ . '/configuration', 'test');
$conf->load();

$conf->get('key'); // full example on the top
```

3) If the operating system has an env variables `CONFIG_PATH` and `STAGE`,
then values for the package will be taken from there.

```bash
export CONFIG_PATH=/configuration
export STAGE=prod
```

```php
<?php
use Spacetab\Configuration\Configuration;

$conf = new Configuration();
$conf->load(); // loaded files from /configuration for prod stage.

$conf->get('key'); // full example on the top
```

4) If u want to see logs and see how load process working,
pass you application logger to the following method:

```php
<?php
use Spacetab\Configuration\Configuration;

$conf = new Configuration();
$conf->setLogger($monolog); // PSR compatible logger.
$conf->load();

$conf->get('key'); // full example on the top
```

If you want you can use [this package](https://github.com/spacetab-io/logger-php) for logs:

```bash
composer require spacetab-io/logger
```

That all.

## CLI utility

Also, you can install simple small cli-utility to dump total results of merged config.
It possible with multiple ways:

1) Install to `/usr/local/bin` as global binary

```bash
L=/usr/local/bin/st-conf && sudo curl -L https://github.com/spacetab-io/configuration-php/releases/download/2.2.0/st-conf.phar -o $L && sudo chmod +x $L
```

2) Install library as global composer requirements

First step:
```bash
composer global require spacetab-io/configuration-php
```

It will be installed to `~/.composer` directory.

If you have `~/.composer/vendor/bin` in globals path, you can try run command:
```bash
st-conf help dump
```

Otherwise, you can be register that directory:
```bash
echo 'export PATH=~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

### CLI Usage

```bash

Arguments:

  stage                  Configuration $STAGE

Options:
  -l, --inline[=INLINE]  The level where you switch to inline YAML [default: 10]
  -s, --indent[=INDENT]  The amount of spaces to use for indentation of nested nodes [default: 2]
  -d, --debug            Debug
  -h, --help             Display this help message
  -q, --quiet            Do not output any message
  -V, --version          Display this application version
